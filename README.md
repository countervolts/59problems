little personal site for me probably gonna show some work ive done and other things

working on the coding section of the site

## website map
- https://59problems.me

  - /
  - /coding
  - /applemusic <- not done
  - /applemusic/users/ <- not done
  - /spotify <- not done
  - /spotify/users/ <- not done
 
## what is with the commits????
basically whenever i (or anyone else) upload files for either by running either spotify or apple music stats calculator it counts towards 22 commits because it uploads the following

  - [/users/ayo](https://github.com/countervolts/59problems/tree/main/spotify/users/ayo) (folder counts as 1 commit) 
  
  - [/users/ayo/images/artists](https://github.com/countervolts/59problems/tree/main/spotify/users/ayo/images/artists) (contains 10 images)
  
  - [/users/ayo/images/songs](https://github.com/countervolts/59problems/tree/main/spotify/users/ayo/images/songs) (contains 10 images)
  
  - [/users/ayo/index.html](https://github.com/countervolts/59problems/blob/main/spotify/users/ayo/index.html) (1 file)

or 21 commits it uploads the same amount for both apple music and spotify (might change in the future probably not)
